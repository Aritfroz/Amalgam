# Amalgam
Amalgam is KAGIC if it took a fully fan-focused direction. Many of the new content straddles the lines of headcanon and falls into fanon for the sake of idealogical experimentation, surrealism, and gameplay benefit.

Because of its experimental and head-forward nature, Amalgam _may_ cause issues with pre-existing gameplay mechanics in vanilla KAGIC, and if done with an unsupported version, can lead to catastrophic consequences.

## Dependencies
Amalgam requires KAGIC 1.10.1, also called **X11p12** or **X11p13**, and Java SE 1.8, to operate.

## Additions
* Drain Lilies, spawned when bushes are drained.
* Steven and Connie, fuses into Stevonnie.
* Gem Shards, crafted from cracked gems, can possess items.
* Citrine, yellow Quartz with defective Ametrine counterpart.
* Ender Pearl, derpy Pearl that acts as warp pad.
* Pyrite, fire-breathing Ruby.
* Mother of Pearl, tallest gem, sneezes Pearls after eating sand.
* Baby Pearl, short baby Pearls born from Mother of Pearl that can be trained to fight.
* Nephrite, shoots acid spit at dangerous mobs and blocks.
* Emerald, unfinished warrior gem, leads Nephrites.
* Aqua Aura Quartz, blue, shiny Quartz gem.
* Watermelon Tourmaline, green Quartz-like gem with a wicked sneeze.

## Changes
* Crux blocks for lightly modded games are enabled but no blocks exist at them moment.
* Pearls can't be grown from Kindergartens and require a **Mother of Pearl**.
* Rubies are social gems, and automatically follow the strongest gem.
* Hessonites kill defective and rebellious gems.

## Fixes
* Ruby dupe glitch is fixed.
* Topaz can fuse again.

## Plans
* Bubbles, allowing users to carry items outside of their inventory and send them to their spawn.
* Slagnests, air-exposed gem seeds spawn slags at a high rate.
* Moonstone, a trader gem inspired by Lenhi's OC, with permission.
* StoKAGIC-style intelligent injectors and gem seeds.
* Whatever [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-bmV2ws_QY) is.
